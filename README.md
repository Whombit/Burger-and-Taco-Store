# Burger-and-Taco-Store
AP CSA Unit 2 project

This is my first like, project projecty thing in java

- How to use -

The program will create a scanner and ask the user what amount of burger patties they want on their burger
Then it asks for the price..? yea I know its weird I slammed this out in a class period because I wanted
to be done with it. I know I could easily give them a value based on intial cost and cost per patty added
but Idgaf lowkey. 
Then it asks if you want a hardshell or a softshell taco, and then if you want it all as a meal.

- How could I improve this -

Yknow, setting an initial price and cost per burger patty and hard/soft shell taco would really not be that
difficult, I just dont feel like going back to fix that right now. Maybe ill re-commit later with that changed

... Maybe.

I could add a gui but hell no thats not worth it. It could be funny tho.
